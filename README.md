# Snake Game

A vaguely similar version of the classic game many played on their Nokia phones in the early 2000’s, this version was created with the Turtle graphics module. Simply run the main.py file to play. 

In creating this game, it was a best approach in OOP to break down the goals into these sections:
- Screen setup and creating a snake body
- Animating the snake segments on screen
- Creating a snake class by using an OOP structure
- Controlling the snake with Keypress
- Detect collisions with food
- Create a scoreboard and keep score
- Detect collisions with the wall
- Detect collisions with your own tail

You’ll also be learn how to slice lists and tuples with the final refactoring. 

Enjoy!
